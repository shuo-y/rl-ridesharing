## Simulation of RL Guide Rider Sharing Driver

The code simulate an environment where a ridersharing driver needs to make decisions about whether or not to take a order with the goal of maximizing the overall profit. 
The code simulate two strategy, one using the greedy approach (`greedy.py`), while the other is the RL based approach (`run_driver.py`).
